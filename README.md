**Finding the Single Salary in an Array**
This Python function, findSingleSalary, helps find a unique salary within an array where every element appears twice except for one.

**How It Works**
The findSingleSalary function uses the following steps:

1- **Iterating and Comparing**: It iterates through the provided array of salaries using nested loops.
2- **Checking for Duplicates**: For each salary in the array, the function compares it to all other salaries in the array.
3- **Identifying the Single Salary**: When it finds a salary that doesn't have a duplicate, it updates the single salary variable to that value.
Approach
The approach taken by the function is to check each salary against all other salaries in the array. When it encounters a salary that doesn't have a duplicate, it returns that as a single salary.

**Usage**
You can use this function by passing your array of salaries to findSingleSalary, and it will output the single salary that appears only once.

**Example:**

    salaries = [25000, 25000, 19000, 19000, 50, 1, 1]
    print(findSingleSalary(salaries))
